    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>This fabulous French toast recipe works with many types of bread — white, whole wheat, brioche, cinnamon-raisin, Italian, or French! Delicious served hot with butter and maple syrup.<br>It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!

        French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.
