    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>These savory homemade seasoned French fries are flavored with garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt. <br>
        “The extra step of battering the fries adds so much flavor, this is a whole different French fry experience,” according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin. <br>
        Store your seasoned fries in an airtight container for up to five days. Avoid reheating them in the microwave. Opt for the oven, air fryer, or stove instead.

    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 ponds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F(175 degrees c)</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry, dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 min.</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
