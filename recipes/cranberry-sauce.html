    <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
    <p>It couldn't be easier to make this fresh cranberry sauce with just three ingredients.
         You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of
          what you can expect:<br>
        Bring the water to a boil, then stir in the sugar and cook until it is dissolved. Add
         the cranberries and bring to a boil again. Reduce the heat and continue cooking
        until the berries have popped and the sauce is chunky. Transfer the sauce to a serving
        dish or jars to cool completely. Mix with a fork before serving.
